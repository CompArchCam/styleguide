title = "en dash (–)"
+++
In TeX, two hyphens (`--`) become an en dash (–).

Use an en dash, not a hyphen, in numeric ranges like *4–10*.

Also use an en dash between words that are balanced with each other but [not part of a compound word](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/46229/1625).
Common examples include *hardware–software*, *producer–consumer*, and things named after multiple people, like *Curry–Howard* or *Lucas–Kanade*.
