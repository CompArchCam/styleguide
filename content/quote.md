Full stops and commas at the ends of quotations go *inside* the quotation marks if the whole sentence is the quote, but *outside* if part of the sentence isn't a quote.
For example:

> My advisor texted me that I had “fixed the last bug”, but I replied that “bugs are forever”.

In TeX, remember to use <code>``</code> for opening and `''` for closing double quotes.
TeX will typeset `"this"` with opening quotes on both sides, which is incorrect.
