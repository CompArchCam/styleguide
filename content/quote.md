Full stops and commas at the ends of quotations go *inside* the quotation marks if the whole sentence is the quote, but *outside* if part of the sentence isn't a quote.
For example:

> My advisor texted me that I had 'fixed the last bug', but I replied that 'bugs are forever'.
> 'Yes,' she said, 'I've just found another!'

In TeX, remember to use `` ` `` for opening and `'` for closing single quotation marks, or two of each for double.
TeX will typeset `'this'` with opening quotation marks on both sides, which is incorrect.
Note that single quotation marks are preferred in British English, with double quotation marks used for a quote within quotes.
