title = "runtime, run-time, run time"
+++
Use *run time* as a noun for the time when execution happens, as in *the error arises at run time*.
Use *run-time* as an adjective phrase before the noun, as in *the system’s run-time behavior*.
Use *runtime* as the noun that is shorthand for *runtime system*, as in *we designed a compiler and runtime*.
(Credit to [James Wilcox][jrw]’s [recollection][p] of [Mike Ernst][ernst].)

Use the same rules for *compile time* and *compile-time* (but *compiletime* is not a thing).
