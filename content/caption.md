Use captions to explain figures, tables, algorithms, etc., rather than limiting them to only a few short words.  Having explanations in the captions (even if they run to several lines) keeps those explanations with the content and means the reader will better understand what you are showing them.

Captions should end in a full stop; sub-captions (e.g. for subfigures) shouldn't.  Captions should appear below the content being described.
