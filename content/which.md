When you're writing a restrictive clause, use the word *that* without a comma before it.  A restrictive clause provides more information to restrict what's being described, so removing it would alter the meaning of the sentence.

In contrast, when you're writing a non-restrictive clause, use the word *which* with a comma before it.  A non-restrictive clause provides extra, non-essential information, so can be removed without altering the meaning of the sentence.

For example, compare the meaning of these two sentences:

> My bike that is red has a puncture.
>
> My bike, which is red, has a puncture.

The first describes my red bike as having a puncture (as opposed to my blue bike, say).  The second implies I only have one bike and it happens to be red.

In British English you can also write *which* without a comma to introduce a restrictive clause, but I find it easier just to use *that* instead.
