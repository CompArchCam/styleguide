This is a collection of hints for writing and typesetting in British English maintained by [Timothy Jones][tim] at the [University of Cambridge][ucam] [Computer Laboratory][cl].
It is a fork of the excellent [style guide][orig] from the [Capra][] research group.
The source for [this guide][thisgh] and [Capra's][capragh] are on GitHub, so you can contribute or fork your own style guide from either.

For more good advice, see [Peter Robinson][pr]'s [page on writing a dissertation][prdiss], [Eddie Kohler][ek]’s [LaTeX usage notes][eklatex] or [Claire Le Goues][clg]’s [things she repeats about writing][clgwriting].

My first point of call if I have a query about writing is the [New Oxford Style Manual, third edition][oxstyle3].
