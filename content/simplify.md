+++
Writing in “academic mode” can tempt you to use phrases that are more complicated than they need to be.
Try to keep things simple, even if it means sounding informal.
Here are some find/replace patterns for simplifying language:

- *which means that* → *so*
- *gives X the ability to* → *lets X*
- *allows X to* → *lets X*
- *is different* → *differs*
- *is built on* → *builds on*
- *it is observed that X* → just *X* or, if necessary, *we observe that X*
- *in order to* → *to*
- *as can be seen in the figure, X* → *the figure shows that X* or just *X*
- *has the potential to* → *could*
- *a sufficient amount of* → *enough*
- *utilize* → *use*
- *make use of* → *use*
- *note that X* → *X*
- *it is worth noting that X* → *X*
