title = "emphasis"
+++

Use italics for emphasising text, not bold.  Bold text stands out too much and gives the emphasis more weight than it deserves.  It also often conflicts with the use of bold for section titles.  Use emphasis sparingly.

In LaTeX, use `\emph{}` to emphasise text rather than using `\textit{}` since the former will correctly style emphasised words within an emphasised phrase and will use the correct style if the document class changes.
