Use capital letters at the start of a sentence, for proper nouns and in acronyms.  Don't be tempted to use them as the first letter to highlight specific words (use emphasis instead) or when you're going to make an acronym.  Instead of:

> This results in a Completely Automated Knowledge Extractor (CAKE)...

Write:

> This results in a completely automated knowledge extractor (CAKE)...
