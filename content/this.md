It can be tempting to chain together two sentences by starting the second one with *this* as a noun.
For example:

> Because the oven was broken, we microwaved the hot pocket. This resulted in a quicker but soggier treat.

This pattern can make the second sentence harder to read because the referent can be ambiguous (at first glance, *this* might be the hot pocket, the oven, or the microwave).
Insert a clarifying noun, such as *this technique* in the sentence above.
