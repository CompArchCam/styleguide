Do not use the [Oxford comma][sc] (also called the serial comma) unless necessary to avoid ambiguity.
In other words, don't have a comma before the final *and* in a list: *locks, transactions and atomics*.
Be aware that [both including it or leaving it out can introduce ambiguity][ambiguity], so read your lists carefully.

Unsurprisingly, omitting this comma differs from the advice in the [New Oxford Style Manual][oxstyle3], but in my opinion it looks ugly.
