To reference a section, use `Section~\ref{...}`. Capitalize *Section* and use
a tilde to make a nonbreaking space. (And the same for tables and figures.) Always use *Section*, even when itâ€™s a subsection or subsubsection.

When explaining figures or tables that show results, refer to them early in the paragraph, usually in the first sentence, and then explain the contents in more detail. For example:

> Figure 9 shows the execution time for each benchmark relative to an unmodified execution. The geometric mean slowdown is 8%. The worst slowdown is streamcluster, which is 31% slower with debugging enabled.
