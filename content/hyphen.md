Use hyphens in [compound modifier phrases][cms785] when they help clarify which words need to be read together.
Specifically, hyphenate compound modifiers that come before the noun they modify, except when they consist of an adverb ending in *-ly*.
Do not hyphenate compound modifiers that come *after* the noun they modify unless you have a really good reason to.

For example, *off-chip DRAM* needs a hyphen, but *uncached data is off chip* does not because *off chip* follows *data*.
On the other hand, *fully connected layer* does not need a hyphen, even though the modified noun *layer* comes last, because the *-ly* suffix in *fully* makes it easy to see how to parse the phrase.

Some phrases can act as modifiers that need hyphens or nouns that do not.
The phrase *state of the art* is a common bugaboo.
Referring to something *in the state of the art* does not need hyphens, but *a state-of-the-art accelerator* does.
