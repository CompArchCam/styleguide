Use hyphens in [compound modifier phrases][cms785] when they help clarify which words go together.
Specifically, hyphenate compound modifiers that come before the noun they modify, except when they consist of an adverb ending in *-ly*.
Do not hyphenate compound modifiers that come *after* the noun they modify unless you have a really good reason to.

For example, you need a hyphen in *language-based security*, *off-chip DRAM*, and *real-time deadline*
but not in *this accelerator is fixed function*.
On the other hand, *fully connected layer* does not need a hyphen, even though the modified noun *layer* comes last, because the *-ly* suffix in *fully* makes it easy to see how to parse the phrase.

Some phrases can act either as modifiers that need hyphens or as nouns that do not.
The phrase *state of the art* is a common bugaboo.
A reference to something *in the state of the art* does not need hyphens, but *a state-of-the-art accelerator* does.

Usually a modifier affects the whole of the phrase that follows, up to the final noun.
So a *standard library function* refers to a library function that comes as standard, whereas a function from the standard library is a *standard-library function*.
However, a hyphen should still be used in situations where it is obvious that the modifier only affects the next word because the usual meaning doesn't make much sense, such as a *data-cache port*.
