title = "e.g. and i.e."
+++
The abbreviation *e.g.* means *for example*, and *i.e.* means something like *in other words*.
Do not italicize them, and always follow them with a comma.
Both need some kind of separating punctuation preceding them, such as a comma, an opening parenthesis, or an em dash.
For example:

> They forgot the most important thing in the world, i.e., breakfast.
> There would be no egg-based foods (e.g., omelettes or quiches) today.
