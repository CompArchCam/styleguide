title = "e.g. and i.e."
+++
The abbreviation *e.g.* means *exempli gratia* (Latin), which translates to *for example*, and *i.e.* means *id est* (Latin), which translates to *that is* or *in other words*.
Do not italicise them, and do not follow them with a comma.
Instead, in LaTeX, use `~` after the dot to keep the spacing correct and keep them on the same line as the following word.
Both need some kind of separating punctuation preceding them, such as a comma, an opening parenthesis, or an em dash.
For example:

> They forgot the most important thing in the world, i.e. breakfast.
> There would be no egg-based foods (e.g. omelettes or quiches) today.

Do not end a list that starts *e.g.* with *etc.*
