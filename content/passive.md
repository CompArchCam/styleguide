Avoid the [passive voice][pv] as much as reasonable.
When you say *the data is converted*, for example, your writing will be clearer if it is more specific about who or what does the conversion: the system, the algorithm, the user, the server, the authors, etc.

Sometimes, rewriting a sentence to avoid the passive voice makes it worse.
Give it an earnest try, but give up if the alternative seems bad.
