Avoid the [passive voice][pv] as much as reasonable.
Instead of saying *the data is converted*, for example, your writing will be clearer if it is more specific about who or what does the conversion: the system, the algorithm, the user, the server, the authors, etc.

An imperfect way to tell whether a sentence is in the passive voice is to try adding *…by space aliens* to the end.
If that works, you probably want to add a subject for your verb.
(Credit to [Melissa O’Neill][melissa] for this trick.)

Sometimes, rewriting a sentence to avoid the passive voice makes it worse.
Give it an earnest try, but give up if the alternative seems bad.
