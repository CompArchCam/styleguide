If you have to list items that are only a sentence or two, consider inlining them into a paragraph, following these rules, where it reads well. (1) Thereâ€™s no need for fancy marker words like *firstly* and *secondly*. (2) Instead, use numerals in parentheses at the beginning of each item.
In LaTeX, this can be easily achieved using the `inline` option to the `enumitem` package.
