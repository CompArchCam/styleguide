Capra Style Guide
=================

This is a guide for writing and typesetting in the [Capra][] research group.

It uses the [Zola][] static site generator.
Every entry in the guide is a Markdown file in the `content` directory.
The templates stitch everything together into one long `index.html` file.
Type `make` to build the page.
