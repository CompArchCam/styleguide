CompArchCam Style Guide
=======================

This is a guide for writing and typesetting in British English maintained by [Timothy Jones][tim] at the [University of Cambridge][ucam] [Computer Laboratory][cl].
It is a fork of the excellent [style guide][orig] from the [Capra][] research group.

It uses the [Zola][] static site generator.
Every entry in the guide is a Markdown file in the `content` directory.
The templates stitch everything together into one long `index.html` file.
Type `make` to build the page.
